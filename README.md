# Group Free-Date & Weather-Based Location Planner mainly one day hikers, bikers and nature visitors 
A data-driven decision system that identifies the best common date and location for group activities by combining availability, weather forecasts, and spatial context.
This project is designed as a practical, research-oriented prototype, built with Python, SQLite, and GitHub Workflows, and aims to demonstrate how automated decision engines can support real-world planning (e.g. hiking, city visits, cultural trips).
