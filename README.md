#Group Free-Date & Weather-Based Location Planner mainly one day hikers, bikers and nature visitors 
A data-driven decision system that identifies the best common date and location for group activities by combining availability, weather forecasts, and spatial context.
This project is designed as a practical, research-oriented prototype, built with Python, SQLite, and GitHub Workflows, and aims to demonstrate how automated decision engines can support real-world planning (e.g. hiking, city visits, cultural trips).

1. What is this?
A privacy-aware outdoor planning prototype that combines weather suitability with voluntary social presence awareness for hiking locations.
2. Why does it exist?
To reduce uncertainty and social discomfort while planning outdoor activities, without enforcing interaction.
3. What problem does it solve?
Choosing dates blindly
Not knowing if a place will be crowded or empty
Wanting optional social familiarity
4. What does it do (currently)?
Select place
Rank dates by weather
Show number of people planning to be there (with consent)
5. What does it not do?
No messaging, no tracking, no real identities.
